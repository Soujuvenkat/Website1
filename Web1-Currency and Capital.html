 <u><h1> Currency and Capital</h1></u>
<u><h2>Currency</h2></u>
<p>The currency used in Tierra Fénix is called Rajata. Rajata means silver in Sanskrit. On one side of the coin there is a phoenix representing new beginnings and the name of the country. On the the other side of the coin there is the name of the country, the year it was made, our government building, and our country motto is engraved on the coin which is “Every ending is a new beginning.” The most valububle currency in Tierra Fénix is the 100 rajata bill because it is the rarest yet the most used. On the front of the 100 rajata bill there is a phoenix and on the other side there is a rising sun to represent hope.

<u><h2>The Capital</h2></u>
<p>The capital of Tierra Fénix is Salita. The word Salita means rise. The reason for the name of the capital Salita to signify a new phoenix rising from its ashes. This because when the people of Tierra Fénix landed in Salita, all they saw was destruction and that nature slowly healing the land and so we turned the remains of the nuclear bomb into our country and making the land anew. Currently Salita is a very diverse and adventurous place where many people come to travel and have fun. It is a beautiful place to live as well as having beautiful landscapes and buildings including the beautiful Gōdāvari waterfall and the famous Vāṇijya skyscraper. It has many fun activitvities and Salita is populated with 15,370,000 people in total and is a very welcoming city.  You can learn a lot about our history and see many inspiring places. We now know that Salita is located where what was once Buenos Aires which was the capital of Argentina back then. It truly is an amazing place to go and enjoy.
