 <u><h1> Landmarks and National animal</h1></u>
<u><h2>Landmarks</h2></u>
<p>
As you may know, Tierra Fénix has many beautiful and famous landmarks throughout the country. But our 2 most important land marks are Gōdāvari waterfall and the Vāṇijya skyscraper. This is because both the landmarks are very important and hold great value. So to start, the beautiful Gōdāvari waterfall is a very beautiful waterfall. It is located in our capital Salita. It has a wonderful view and is visited by many people every year. It also is home to many rare species including our national animal the Elguardián. As for why it is significant to us, the Gōdāvari waterfall is where our people first landed and saw true beauty after a very long time. Now the famous Vāṇijya skyscraper is in the center of Salita where many tourists go to explore and look around in many of the famous avenues. The Vāṇijya skyscraper is a building where many people go to find work, trade, and make business deals. It is also a place to go if you are a small business looking for an opportunity to go big. The Vāṇijya skyscraper is significant because it is the center of economics and business. But apart from economics and business you can go inside and get a wonderful view of the capital. Both of the landmarks are the best places to go and visit so make sure if you ever come to Salita, you see the two landmarks.

<u><h2>National Animal</h2></u>
<p>Our national animal is the Elguardián which means the guardian. The Elguardián it is a mix of a phoenix, griffin, and a tiger. It has the body of a tiger, the wings of a griffin, and the tail of a phoenix. The phoenix part of the Elguardián represents new beginnings. The tiger part represents strength and ambition. Finally the Griffin part of the Elguardián represents leadership and valor.  So in all, the Elguardián represents new beginnings, strength, ambition, leadership, and valor. The Elguardián is only found in our capital Salita specifically in the Gōdāvari waterfalls. We chose the Elguardián as our national animal because it represents the new beginnings, strength, ambition, leadership, and valor of our country.
