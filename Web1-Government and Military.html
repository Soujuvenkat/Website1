 <u><h1> Government and military</h1></u>
<u><h2> Our Government</h2></u>
<p>We have a democratic government. We have president and vice president who is in charge of the country and serves the country for a term of 5 years. The president and vice president is elected by the people representatives. As for how the people representatives are chosen; people in each state will vote for their state representatives. There will be 60 state representatives in all from all the states. In every 500,000 people there will be 1 state representative. Then the state representives chosen will elect one to be the state leader and then the state leader will select the head for each of the state departments. The state departments are, health, finance, securtity,indistriey, agriculture, and infrastucture. The representives will be in charge for 5 years along with the president. The president and vice president is elected by the state representatives.  Then the president will choose the heads for the central departments. The different central departments are health, finance, militery, external affires, industiries, legal, mining, forestry, export/import, infrastructure, and education. The government is split into three branches. These are the elective, judicial, and executive. First, the elective teams job is to create new laws. These laws can be passed by wining the vote of â…” majority of votes from the representatives.  Then they pass it on to the Judicial to verify and approve the law as per the legal binding terms. Then finally, the executive team helps the people to follow the law once the law has been approved by the Legal and Judicial building. Take to note that none of the three branches have all the power. They each have equal powers and cannot take over each others duties without approval from all the other buildings.

<u><h2>Military</h2></u>
<p>We have 3 branches of military. They are the armed battalion, sea force, and wing commenders. The armed battalion are the fighters on land. They fight on land. The Sea force is in control of the sea. They make sure no trouble is happening in the ocean. Then their is the wing commanders. The fight in the sky and reach the clouds. Our military is a very strong, disiplined, and brave group of soldiers who are ready to fight when a problem arises. There are many rules and requirements to enlist in any field of the military. To start, you must be a must be a citizen to join. You have to be at least 18 years old to join and younger than 32. Only under very special circumstances can you enlist over the age of 32. There have been soldiers over 32 re-enlist before so it is possible. Once you enlist you must serve for 2 years and if you would like you can re-enlist if under the age of 32.  You also must have a clean record and at least be finished with high school. There are certain health requirnments you need to qualify. For example you must not have any unresolved mental health issues or prolonged/recurrent or more severe diagnoses. Finally you must pass a written and physical test to see if you are fit enough to join. While in service you will get some benefits one of which is getting a free house and education for your family along with your salary. The strength of our military is great. To start,  in the armed battalion there are about 2,00,000 soldiers who are very cabable and are trained to be ready for anything. The sea force has about 15 Battle ships, 5 submarines, 2 air craft carriers, and 1,00,000 experienced sailers. Finally the air force has about 300 Battle air crafts and 1,00,000/- people.
