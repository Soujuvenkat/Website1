 <u><h1> Our History</h1></u>
<u><h2> Our history according to the gran libro</h2></u>
<u><h3> What happend before </h3></u>
<p>It is said, that November 19, 2026, was when the world turned upside down. But let's not talk about that day. Let's talk about the day before. It was a chilly day outside and the President was going through a major political problem. All the countries of the world were slowly starting to disagree on many things and tension was growing. For example, many small countries were falling apart due to many political and financial disagreements and leaders were scrambling to figure out the solution since many leaders were being overthrown and different gangs were causing chaos everywhere but right now the President of the United States of America couldn’t think about the world's problems for he was dealing with his own internal political issues. Besides, he had helped enough. He had given as much support and ideas to the other countries for how to fix issues but all of them declined his ideas and governments were falling. And the president had to keep the country and people he was leading safe. But as his son came running into his office and his older daughter chasing behind him, the President forgot all his thoughts.
    Meanwhile, in a secret place where all the enemies met, the leader of all the fighters who were trying to stop those enemies was held for ransom and the president of Russia was currently being forced to release all their nukes. And after hours of discussing with other members, he was considering pressing the button. But he resisted.  And after one week of seeing the members suffering while no other country tried to save them. He had had enough. He gave up and pressed the button that disarmed all the neuclear bombs. The nukes were released and people felt the ground rumbling. The news warned people of where to go and very few packed some things and evacuated to the bunkers. Everyone had fled to the bunkers. Even now, we have no idea if anyone was left behind or worse.

<u><h3>Our Migration</h3></u>
<p> Finally, after 20 years of waiting in the bunkers, it was safe to come out of the bunkers, and just as the scientists predicted, all the borders were gone.  It was a race for land, so everyone was given a choice of who they wanted to go with and everyone came out of the bunkers. We, the people of Tierra Fénix had to travel in big boats to find land which is now our country. We had a tough time getting there though. Many people got seasick and many people started to not have enough food or water to eat and drink and people were getting angry. There were many fights and arguments in the beginning and throughout the whole journey. Some disagrements were very tough but after working hard to find solutions we figured it out by making a system that ensured everyone was given what they needed and everyone was heard and soon everyone was happy and somewhat healthy for the rest of the journey. During that time, we barely had any interactions other than the 2 times we saw and barely communicated with, our current allies Kawtah and Maksromvony. We now know that the whole journey took us 4 months and 19 days.

<u><h3>Naming our Country</h3></u>
<p>Our country is named Tierra Fénix which means phoenix land. We have two core reasons to why the name mean phoenix land. The first reason is a simple one. We chose the name Tierra Fénix because ever since we came out of the bunkers we had to adjust to our new lives and find new purposes. While also building a new home for ourselves and understand our present and figure out our future and what we can do moving on. But there is another reason. It said that when we were near to our land on the ship, people saw a phoenix. We don’t know if it was because of sea-sickness and people were hallucinating, but it is said that the phoenix guided us to our land and showed us the Gōdāvari waterfall which was the first time seeing natural beauty in days. It gave people hope and the phoenix showed people where to start building our homes and make our country the beautiful country it is now. But before the phoenix left it gave a feather to our leader and it is the only evidence that the phoenix even existed in the first place. It is in the possession of each and every president and it is passed down to the next. 
</p>
<u><h3>Our Flag</h3></u>
<p>Our flag has a deep meaning and it explains about what we had to go through in the makings our country. The first color on our flag is blue. The blue on our flag represents trust. This is because throughout of what we had to endure, we had to have a lot of trust in each other and ourselves. We had to trust that everyone was doing their part and that they would help when the time came while also having to trust ourselves to believe that we can survive anything and that an ended chapter can lead into a new one. By putting in the trust, we gave ourselves the opportunity to build our communities and thrive. The next color on our flag is the maroon. The maroon color on our flag represents valor and strength because we had to be very strong both physically and mentally. This is because we had to be very strong and have great courage during our in the bunkers and when we traveled to find a land to call home.  We had to support each other and be brave and strong so others could be brave and strong too.  Next is the phoenix on our flag. The phoenix symbolizes new beginnings. When we came out of the bunkers and found a land to claim, we had to build our lives from the ground up. We had to understand that our chapter in the bunkers was over and we are now making a new chapter for ourselves.It also has to do with how the phoenix guided us when we came here. The last color on our flag represents happiness, friendship, and loyalty because now we are very happy and we are kind and loyal people. We help each other and make sure the majority is happy and everyone is being kind and loyal to each other.
