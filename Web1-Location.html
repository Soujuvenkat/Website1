 <u><h1>Location</h1></u>
<p>When the people of Tierra Fénix first arrived to the land which would eventually become Tierra Fénix, all they saw was land. Land that stretched from miles to miles. They didn’t even know where they were. And so they started to explore. As tired as they were they explored and found many beautiful places where they could make their homes. One of which is the most beautiful lanscapes in Tierra Fénix, the Gōdāvari waterfall. Soon they made a map and started building the country and making it into the country it is now. Tierra Fénix is located where what used to be South America. It takes over where Argentina, Chile, and Uraguay used to be. Tierra Fénix is under the countries Arbolderio, Guitunda, and Rosaviva. Tierra Fénix lies almost entirely within the temperate zone of the Southern Hemisphere, unlike the rest of the continent to the north, which lies within the tropics. Tierra Fénix mostly has a subtropical climate and so it ensures an incredible natural diversity that has attracted nature lovers for many years. Each and every part of our country offers a different ecosystem from the tropics to mountins, waterfalls to glaciers and various species of wildlife in between while having kind and welcoming people with various diversity.
